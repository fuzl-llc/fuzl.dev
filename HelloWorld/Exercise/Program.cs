/*

The /* characters denote the beginning of a "comment." Comments are ignored by the compiler and are 
primarily for the developer to document their code. We'll use comments to describe the code we want 
to write.

First we have to create a class. We do that by typing the following text. Be sure to do this after 
the end of this comment block which ends with the * and / character. We can't actually write them 
together or we'd end this comment and we don't want to do that yet... So, here is what you need to 
type, down at the bottom of this file:

class Program
{
}

Then, inside the curly brackets, we have to create a function (or "method") to be the entry point
to the application:

static void Main()
{
}

Finally, we have to write the code we want to run when the program runs. We want to write "Hello 
World!" to the console, so we need the following code inside the Main method.

System.Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");

That's it. Once you're done with the code, you can press the F5 key to run it. Good luck!
